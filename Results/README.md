# Annotations and SNP positions

*    The files below are the result of running SNP positions from the iSelect design file inferred with BWA and SNP_Utils against the GFF for 'Vunguiculata_IT97K-499-35_v1.0.fa.gz'.
*    Results are from [VeP](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html), files including\
Cowpea_snps.txt - variant types for all SNPs in iSelect design file\
Cowpea_snps.txt_summary.html - VeP html summary of iSelect design SNPs\
Cowpea_vep_err_snps.txt - VeP error output
